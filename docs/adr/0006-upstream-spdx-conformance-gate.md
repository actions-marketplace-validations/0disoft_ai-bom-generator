# Upstream SPDX conformance gate

Status: Accepted

## Decision

Use `spdx3-validate>=0.0.7,<1`, a validator recommended by the
[SPDX model project](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/serialization/jsonld/validation.md),
for both upstream JSON Schema structure and SHACL semantics. This is a CI-only
verification dependency, not a runtime dependency. Stable updates within the
declared major range are selected at gate execution and the resolved version
is recorded in its output. A new major requires a deliberate policy change.
SPDX vocabulary/context/schema target remains the released 3.0.1 specification.

The bounded wrapper accepts no caller paths. It reads only synthetic checked-in
fixtures and generates synthetic sparse/complete previews in a temporary
directory. Network access is limited by purpose to installing verification
dependencies and retrieving public SPDX context/schema/model documents. No
user BOMs or private model evidence are sent to an online validation service.
The gate calls upstream schema and graph validation APIs with reviewed resources
cached in memory. Each of the three resource downloads has a 30-second timeout
and a 2 MiB ceiling; the whole gate retains its ten-minute limit. SHA-256 digests
bind the context, schema and SHACL model to reviewed bytes and appear alongside
the resolved validator version in logs. Integrity, size and network failures are
resource errors, not mapping rejections or passing skips. The cache lasts for one
run only; this is not an offline or persistent cross-run cache. Review upstream
changes before updating resource hashes.

## Proven scope

- Minimal reference: Core CreationInfo, Organization and SpdxDocument plus an
  AI AIPackage, using canonical serialized names and profile identifiers.
- Complete reference: the above plus Software File/Package and a Core
  `contains` relationship. Complete means complete **fixture**, not every field
  or relationship in every SPDX profile.
- Both reference inputs and their JSON import/re-serialization roundtrips must
  pass upstream JSON Schema and SHACL checks.
- Removing required `CreationInfo.created` must produce an attributed rejection.
- Actual CLI outputs from sparse and complete projects must retain
  `aiBom:conformance=partial` and be rejected by the upstream gate. This negative
  baseline makes the current compatibility gap executable, rather than claiming
  that a passing local preview schema proves upstream conformance.

## Evidence and mapping boundaries

Reference creation dates are explicitly declared synthetic test data, not
observed model creation or release dates. Production collectors do not invent
timestamps, creators, suppliers or dataset facts. SPDX permits source-derived
creation dates for reproducibility; adopting one in production still requires
a trustworthy declared/observed source and a documented compatibility change.

The existing normalized model remains exporter-independent. Core/Software/AI
fixture primitives and containment are covered; Dataset, Build, Security and
licensing relationship mappings are not. Raw declared license text remains a
preview extension, never a concluded license. Missing versions remain preview
`NOASSERTION` text, not an assertion of an upstream license or element identity.
Human-declared metadata remains distinct from tool-observed paths and hashes.

## Promotion boundary

The opt-in `spdx-json-3.0.1` mapping now uses explicit `[spdx]` authorship
and creation time (CLI timestamp override allowed). Its actual sparse/complete
CLI outputs must pass positive upstream checks; missing creator and relationship
source checks must fail. The original `spdx-ai` format retains its negative
baseline for backward compatibility. See the SPDX contract for bounded mapping
scope and comment-preserved evidence; no additional profile coverage is claimed.

The original decision established the upstream gate, not a preview exporter upgrade.
Do not rename current preview fields, discard evidence, or set conformance to
full just to pass it. A future mapper change must replace the expected-preview-
rejection checks with positive checks for actual CLI output, add invalid
relationship/license/source cases for the expanded scope, and document migration
for existing preview consumers. The open design is retained in the mapping
follow-up proposal, not silently approved by this ADR.

## Consumer interoperability

The same gate reads actual compatible sparse and complete CLI outputs with
the official `spdx-python-model>=0.0.6,<1` object-model library (Apache-2.0).
This CI-only dependency has no runtime dependency on the producer. It must
resolve document roots, authors and relationship endpoints into typed objects,
and preserve names, versions and comment-encoded evidence. Its resolved version
is logged. Comments remain application-readable text, not native Dataset or
licensing semantics. Passing these cases demonstrates library interoperability,
not support by every SPDX UI, vulnerability scanner or ingestion service.

## Recovery

A validator or upstream-service failure blocks the conformance job and requires
diagnosis. Do not disable the gate, convert network failures into expected
invalid fixtures, or claim a new export contract. Existing offline CLI behavior
and CycloneDX validation remain independent of this CI-only service dependency.
