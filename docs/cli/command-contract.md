# Command Contract

Status: Accepted contract
Repository Type: cli-tool

## Repository Type Contract

This repository type owns command behavior, arguments, flags, config loading, exit codes, terminal output, JSON output, runtime compatibility, and shell integration contracts.

## Source of Truth

- Product decision: AI-BOM Generator is a local evidence collector and BOM exporter.
- Technical owner: [maintainer policy](../ops/maintainer-policy.md).
- Related ADR: docs/adr/0001-initial-architecture-boundaries.md

## Executable Decisions

- Command list and flag ownership: `ai-bom --version` reports the installed package version, and `ai-bom generate` generates an AI-BOM from one model directory.
- Exit-code taxonomy: numeric codes and warning-policy behavior are governed by
  [output and exit codes](output-and-exit-codes.md).
- Machine-readable output contract: JSON summary must include output paths, warning counts, exporter, hash algorithm, and completeness status without embedding full source file contents.
- Config precedence and default behavior: explicit CLI flags override config;
  explicit `--config` paths override automatic config discovery; environment-variable
  config is out of MVP until redaction and precedence are designed.
- Runtime compatibility: Python 3.12 through 3.14.
- CLI adapter boundary: `argparse` may own argument parsing and exit-code translation, but application and domain layers must not import it.

## CLI Shape

```text
ai-bom --version
ai-bom completion <bash|powershell>

ai-bom generate <model-directory>
  [--config <path>]
  [--format <cyclonedx-json-1.7|spdx-ai|spdx-json-3.0.1>]
  [--document-created <ISO-timestamp-with-timezone>]
  --output <path>
  --warning-report <path>
  --summary <path|->
  [--manifest <path>]
  [--error-report <path>]
  [--warnings <allow|fail>]
  [--redaction <strict|off>]
  [--discover-artifacts | --no-discover-artifacts]
  [--max-artifact-matches <integer>]
  [--max-artifact-bytes <integer>]
  [--max-total-artifact-bytes <integer>]
  [--max-scan-entries <integer>]
```

The exact binary name, flag names, accepted formats, and output filename defaults
are implemented for the current MVP CLI. `cyclonedx-json-1.7` is the default
format. `spdx-ai` emits an SPDX 3.0.1 AI Profile preview with partial
conformance and local preview-schema validation. MVP prefers explicit output paths over
silently writing into the target model directory. Generated output paths must
resolve outside the target model directory and must not overlap each other.
Overlapping output paths include identical resolved paths and parent-child
resolved paths.
When `--error-report` is provided, hard failures atomically replace that path
with an `ai-bom-error-report/v1` JSON envelope. The path must remain outside the
target model directory and must not overlap generated output paths. Successful
and warning-only generation removes any stale file at the requested path.
Argument parsing failures can emit the same envelope when a usable
`--error-report` value was supplied. The report does not join the successful
output manifest and does not replace the summary or warning report.
The CLI writes a generation manifest for each successful output set. When
`--manifest` is omitted, the manifest defaults to `<summary>.manifest.json` for
file summaries and `<output>.manifest.json` when `--summary -` writes the summary
to stdout. The manifest records a run-unique generation id plus role, path,
size, and SHA-256 digest entries for every final JSON output in the set.
When `--config` is omitted, the CLI checks only `<model-directory>/aibom.toml`.
It does not search parent directories or alternate filenames. If that file does
not exist, the CLI uses inline defaults.
When `--format` is omitted, the discovered or explicit config file's
`[output].format` value is used. If neither CLI nor config declares a format,
`cyclonedx-json-1.7` is used as the current executable default.
When `--warnings` is omitted, the discovered or explicit config file's
`[warning_policy].missing_metadata` value is used. Config `warn` maps to the
executable `allow` behavior and config `fail` maps to the executable `fail`
behavior.
Discovered and explicit config files are validated against AI-BOM config schema
v1 before new final output files are written. After output-path validation
succeeds, the CLI preserves previous outputs until a new output set is ready
to commit. Config, collection, and export failures leave that previous set
unchanged. The Action wrapper separately removes stale requested outputs before
invoking the CLI and verifies the new manifest before exposing outputs.

## Review Blockers

- A command changes without updating help, examples, output, and exit-code expectations.
- JSON output exposes generated or existing file contents.
- Runtime compatibility changes without smoke validation.

## Artifact Overrides

See [artifact overrides](artifact-overrides.md) for discovery enable/disable flags,
config precedence, positive budget values, and hard ceilings.
