# Config Contract v1

Status: Accepted for MVP runtime validation

## Purpose

This file defines the approved MVP config contract for explicit config files.

The source contract schema lives at `schemas/aibom-config-v1.schema.json`.
The packaged runtime copy lives at
`src/ai_bom_generator/config/schema/aibom-config-v1.schema.json` and must stay
byte-equivalent at the JSON object level.

## Filename

`aibom.toml` is the approved filename for explicit MVP config examples and
fixtures. When `--config` is omitted, the CLI discovers only
`<model-directory>/aibom.toml`. It does not search parent directories, alternate
filenames, or environment variables. If the target-root `aibom.toml` is absent,
the CLI uses inline defaults and reports missing optional metadata as warnings.

## Required Properties

- `schema_version`: config schema version.

`output.format` is optional; omission uses the CLI default unless overridden.

## Sections

- `warning_policy.missing_metadata`: `warn` or `fail`; unsupported-field
  warnings are not separately configurable.
- `generation.marker`: optional target-root-relative producer generation marker
  path governed by ADR 0004.
- `output.format`: `cyclonedx-json-1.7`, `spdx-ai` or `spdx-json-3.0.1`.
- `spdx`: optional document metadata table with `creator_name`, `creator_type`
  (Person or Organization), and `created` (quoted timestamp with timezone).
  These are required only for the compatibility format; CLI
  `--document-created` can supply or override `created`.
- `model`: declared model metadata and model-card path.
- `artifacts`: include and exclude patterns for model artifacts and checkpoints,
  plus explicit opt-in artifact discovery.
- `dependencies`: explicit dependency-file references, scalar metadata, and an
  optional `parse` boolean.
- `datasets`: declared dataset references.
- `prompts`: declared prompt references; prompt contents are never included.
- `evals`: declared eval artifact references.
- `training`: declared training-code or pipeline references.

The config file is limited to 1 MiB. `artifacts.include` and
`artifacts.exclude` accept at most 256 patterns each. The five reference
sections (`dependencies`, `datasets`, `prompts`, `evals`, and `training`) accept
at most 1,000 entries in total; each individual section is also schema-bounded
to 1,000 entries. Inputs over these budgets fail before collection or output
writes.

## Supported Field Values

The executable implementation collects scalar string, number, and boolean values
from metadata and reference sections. Structured values such as arrays or nested
tables are ignored with an `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG_FIELD` warning until the field is
explicitly modeled.

The runtime schema validates section shape, config version, artifact pattern
types, artifact discovery opt-in type, warning-policy field names and values,
known top-level sections, and known path fields before output files are written.
It intentionally allows
unknown nested values in metadata/reference
objects so the collector can emit `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG_FIELD` warnings instead of
silently dropping user intent.

## Artifact Discovery

Artifact discovery is disabled by default. `[artifacts].discovery = true` is the
config opt-in control. CLI enable/disable and bounded limits follow `docs/cli/artifact-overrides.md`. When enabled, the collector adds
bounded default model artifact patterns for `.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.bin`,
`.pt`, `.pth`, `.ckpt`, and `.onnx` files. Explicit `[artifacts].include`
patterns may still be used with discovery.

Discovery applies built-in excludes for hidden, cache, dependency, virtualenv,
build, and Git metadata paths before hashing. Discovery still uses the artifact
match-count, single-file byte, total-byte, target-root, symlink, and
no-fabrication warning policies.

## Producer Generation Marker

`[generation].marker` optionally points to a caller-owned JSON file inside the
target root. The file is limited to 4 KiB, may not be a symlink, and must contain
only `schema_version`, `generation`, and `state`. Collection starts only from a
`complete` marker and succeeds only when the same complete marker bytes remain
after all governed reads.

The producer must atomically publish `state = "writing"` before changing any
governed input, then atomically publish a new generation with
`state = "complete"` after finalizing every input. The CLI never creates or
repairs the marker and never copies the raw generation value into output.

## Precedence

Explicit CLI flags override config values. Explicit `--config` paths override
automatic discovery. When `--format` is omitted, the executable implementation
uses `[output].format` from the discovered or explicit config file and falls
back to `cyclonedx-json-1.7` when the config does not declare an output format.
When `--warnings` is omitted, `[warning_policy].missing_metadata = "warn"` maps
to the executable `allow` behavior and `"fail"` maps to the executable `fail`
behavior. The CLI `--warnings` flag overrides this config value.
Environment-variable config is out of MVP until redaction and precedence
behavior are explicitly designed.

## Dependency Lockfiles

Dependency-file intake is config-driven. Every `[[dependencies]]` entry keeps
its declared file path and scalar metadata as evidence. Supported Python files
are also parsed unless `parse = false`:

- `type = "uv"` or an undeclared type with path `uv.lock` parses the TOML
  `package` array.
- `type = "pip"` or `type = "requirements"` parses PEP 508 requirement lines,
  including exact pins, ranges, markers, extras, direct URLs, continuations,
  and hash options.
- `type = "conda-lock"` parses the unified conda-lock v1 YAML package array,
  including Conda and pip managers, declared platforms, remote package URLs,
  matched metadata channels, and MD5 or SHA-256 artifact hashes.
- `type = "poetry"` parses Poetry 2.x TOML package arrays, including exact
  versions, package markers, per-file artifact hashes, package source locators
  or indexes, and resolved Git revisions.
- `type = "pipenv"` parses Pipenv `Pipfile.lock` specification 6 JSON, including
  exact versions, artifact hashes, extras, PEP 508 markers, declared package
  indexes, Git references, remote files, and local paths.
- When `type` is absent, `requirements*.txt` and `requirements.lock` paths use
  the requirements parser. Exact filenames `poetry.lock` and `Pipfile.lock` use
  the Poetry and Pipenv parsers. `conda-lock.yml`, `conda-lock.yaml`, and
  `*.conda-lock.yml|yaml` paths use the conda-lock parser.

Requirements-file includes, constraints, editable installs, local paths,
dependency or Conda environment solving, package downloads, and automatic
discovery are not followed. Conda explicit and environment lock formats are not
treated as unified conda-lock YAML. Poetry 1.x metadata hash layouts, project
dependency resolution, selected dependency-group inference, and local source
reads are not performed. Pipenv dependency-group selection, dependency
resolution, and local source reads are not performed. Unsupported or malformed
entries produce warnings and no fabricated package components. Package-lock
and other formats remain unsupported.

Parsed package evidence uses one normalized source contract. It preserves the
source kind plus strict-redacted locator, channel, index, platform, revision,
and artifact hashes when the selected parser has direct evidence for those
fields. uv registry sources populate the source index, uv Git sources preserve
their resolved fragment or declared revision, uv sdist and wheel entries retain
their hashes and locators, and requirements retain `--hash` plus recognized
direct-URL fragment hashes. Platform markers remain marker expressions; they
are not flattened into an invented platform value. Conda-lock package platforms
must appear in `metadata.platforms`; package URLs are preserved as locators, and
channels are emitted only when a declared metadata channel matches that URL.
Poetry registry packages remain source type `registry`; legacy source URLs map
to source indexes, Git sources preserve their resolved reference when present,
and file hashes retain their declared artifact filename as locator evidence.
Poetry package groups and package extras are not converted into selected extras
because the lockfile does not prove which installation selection the caller used.
One marker shared by every group is preserved. Differing group-specific markers
produce a partial warning and remain absent because one flat marker would
misrepresent the unresolved group selection.
Pipenv `default` and `develop` entries are collected without claiming either
group was selected. An explicit entry index resolves through `_meta.sources`;
unknown source names remain raw index evidence with a partial warning. Git
references and package hashes are preserved directly, while remote files and
local paths are never opened.

All normalized source fields and artifact hashes participate in package
identity, so equal names and versions backed by different sources or artifacts
remain distinct BOM components. Each package is limited to 256 distinct
artifact hash records, where equal digests from different artifact locators
remain separate evidence. Unsupported or malformed source evidence warns and remains
absent rather than being fabricated.

## Review Blockers

- Config accepts implicit secrets or network credentials without a redaction policy.
- Config requires prompt, dataset, eval, or model-card contents to be copied into output.
- Config permits target-root escape or symlink escape by default.
